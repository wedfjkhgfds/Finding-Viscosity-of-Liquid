# Finding-Viscosity-of-Liquid
A body moving in a fluid feels a frictional force in a direction opposite to its direction of motion. The magnitude of this force depends on the geometry of the body, its velocity, and the internal friction of the fluid. A measure for the internal friction is given by the dynamic viscosity Î·.
